"""
Risk assessment module for the RakshaRide parametric insurance platform.

Calculates a location-based risk score for each delivery zone by analysing:
  - Historical frequency of weather disruptions in the area
  - Average severity of past disruption events
  - Seasonal adjustment factors

The resulting risk score is used to determine the location risk category
(low / moderate / high / very_high), which in turn influences the weekly
premium multiplier applied to each delivery partner's policy.
